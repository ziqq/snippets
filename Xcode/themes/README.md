Export of my Xcode themes to sync between macbooks

Custom syntax color themes are located in

~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/ (Note that this directory may not exist if you've not yet modified any of your themes or haven't created a custom theme of your own, but will be created as soon as you do.)

The files have a .dvtcolortheme .xccolortheme extension. Simply retrieve the file from that directory and copy it into the same directory on another machine.
